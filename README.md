# ontoProc: a Bioconductor package to help survey and use Cell Ontology, and many other ontologies 


The ambitions of collaborative single cell biology 
will only be achieved through the coordinated efforts 
of many groups, to help clarify cell types 
and dynamics in an array of functional and 
environmental contexts.  The use of formal ontology in 
this pursuit is well-motivated and research progress has 
already been substantial. 

With this package, we review key concepts and tasks required to
make progress in the adoption and application of ontological discipline
in Bioconductor-oriented data analysis.
